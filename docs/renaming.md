# Context

Features in `luminance` has been highly shaped by technology (OpenGL / Vulkan). However, the opinionated API starts to
get augmented with concepts that donâ€™t exist in low-level APIs, such as `ShaderData`, color slots, etc. It might be
necessary to rename the concepts / features to move away from the low-level API and get an API that easier to think
about, and more abstract.
