# luminance-sdl2

> **Important notice**: The current status of the crate is on-pause because of
> [rust-sdl2 #1029](https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2/issues/1029). If you are willing to get updates of
> `luminance-sdl2`, you are free to open a PR to update the code and make it work whatever the workaround. Because
> [phaazon/luminance-rs] strives to test as much code as possible, every active crate should be tested and maintained.
> This SDL2 crate doesn’t meet the standards because of its dependencies, so it’s currently and temporarily put aside.
