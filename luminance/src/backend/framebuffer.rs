/// Framebuffer backend.
///
/// A type implementing [`Framebuffer`] must implement [`TextureBase`] in the first place, because framebuffers and
/// textures have a strong relationship.
///
/// Framebuffers implement a strong type contract with the safe interface and are associated with [`ColorSlot`] and
/// [`DepthSlot`]. Those types provide associated types to adapt the kind of data that will be allocated and provided to
/// the user. For instance, if you want to have a framebuffer that will not have any depth information, you can use `()`
/// as a [`DepthSlot`]. The backends will then not allocate anything and no depth data will be present at runtime.
///
/// The whole process of implementing this trait revolves around three main aspects:
///
/// 1. How to create the framebuffer on the backend. This is the [`Framebuffer::new_framebuffer`] method.
/// 2. How to attach color and depth data, which are [`Framebuffer::attach_color_texture`] and
///   [`Framebuffer::attach_depth_texture`].
/// 3. Valide the resulting framebuffer.
///
/// `D` is the dimension of the framebuffer, which must implement [`Dimensionable`], reifying the dimension at runtime.
/// This is a useful type to the backends, as it will provide methods to get the size, offsets, etc. to correctly create textures.
